# SPACE DEBRIS



## Problem

We are facing a significant problem: space debris. The current situation is that 30k derbis object are orbiting out there, above our heads. It is already affecting us by disrupting astronomical observations and it could affect space missions over the following years.

However, the real issue goes beyond that. Most people are unaware of it. This is what we aim to solve.




## Proposal

There is plenty of information online, but not in a format that educates in a clear, engaging way. This is why we are proposing an interactive website, where people can both learn about the problem and enjoy the experience.

Therefore, our solution to the challenge consists on an interactive and educational webpage, which aims to raise concerns about the hazards of space debris. The web includes an interacting and dynamic orrery of space debris around the Earth made with Unity and using Keplerian parameters, which allows users to get used to these objects. We also present information for adults since we talk about the challenges of orbiting objects, and even for kids, who can play a video game to discover the hazards of space debris. Furthermore, we have made a projection of the evolution of orbiting objects based on current data and trends. All of this, combined with a series of proposed solutions, will lead to higher awareness among society about space debris, as well as deeper developments in space debris policies.
